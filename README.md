If youre reading this chances are youre already familiar with Meta support and still need help with your Oculus. Despite facing negative experiences with Meta, VR is capable of bringing new emotions and at moment Oculus is one of best options for this. Do not treat this instruction as a universal one. After all even in Meta company itself I do not know about many errors and solutions to problems in software.


# Instruction

1. If Facebook is not available in your country, then you will need a VPN. You need to distribute Internet within same network for VR glasses and applications on your smartphone. The easiest way to do this is with Wi-Fi on a laptop. If you get already into an endless boot process then you can reset settings helmet by holding button down **"power"** and **"volume buttons"**. Then select **"Factory Reset"** from menu.

2. For example lets take [VPN Psiphon](https://psiphon.ca). You need to install Windows version and enable **L2TP/IPSec** in transport mode settings. This is necessary in order to be able to use VPN for distribution within your network. Next you have to enable mobile hotspot in windows. You can find out how to do it in the official instructions ["Use your Windows PC as a mobile hotspot"](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-your-windows-pc-as-a-mobile-hotspot-c89b0fad-72d5-41e8-f7ea-406ad9036b85) If you encounter a problem using standard tools windows see step 3.

3. If you encounter Wi-Fi sharing issues in step 2. Then you need to use software [Connectify Hotspot](https://connectify.me). The purpose of this software is same  create a Wi-Fi hotspot. To do this, you need to start the VPN and select Psiphon in "Wi-Fi Network to Repeat" list then enter network name and password and click Start Hotspot. Please note that this software is paid. But there is also a free period that should be enough for complete first steps of setup.

4. After update has been downloaded and installed you will be asked to enter numbers from screen. For this you need to install an app on your smartphone called Oculus. If you already have Facebook then you just need to click button sign in with Facebook and sign in to your account. Next you should be prompted to sign in to Oculus using Facebook. This may not happen and to fix this you can try to log into your account again with using app Oculus. You don't need to do anything on Facebook itself it should happen automatically. If you do not have a Facebook account then see next step. You will also be ask in vr helmet to turn on bluetooth and connect to your phone. Next follow instructions in vr helmet to complete setup.

5. The Facebook system is very sensitive. Therefore it is best to use a phone number that has already been used on Instagram or WhatsApp. So less likely to face automatic blocking after registration. If you previously had Facebook and use same email then most likely system will block you automatically after registration. During registration process you need to do everything slowly so that system does not take you for a bot. If you do everything right and system does not consider you a bot then you will be able to connect to Oculus. Otherwise you will need to appeal and follow further Facebook requirements or try to register a new account.

6. After you have finished setting up, you will be taken to virtual room. At this stage you can already use full virtual reality helmet. If you decide to connect a virtual reality helmet to your PC then follow step 7.
